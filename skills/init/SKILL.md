description: Interview the user about the app they want before anything is created — what it does, its screens and data, the iOS releases and devices, architectures, Objective-C or Swift, SwiftUI and Combine, frameworks and backports, identity, and where it is published — then write the decisions to PROJECT.md. Use first, in an empty directory, whenever someone asks for an app for old iOS (iOS 5, 6, 7, 9, armv7, iPhone 3GS/4/4S, iPad 2, iPod touch, jailbreak, Cydia), or when PROJECT.md is missing or incomplete. Reads answers.md first if one is present.

# The interview

Nothing is created before this is finished: no `xmake.lua`, no source file, no install. The output is
one file, `PROJECT.md`, that every later step reads. The approach is a design-tree interview (credit
at the end): the decisions form a tree, you ask in rounds, you recommend an answer to every question,
you look facts up yourself, and you stop only when every branch is settled and the user has confirmed.

## 1. Look before asking

- The directory: if `PROJECT.md` exists, this is a resumed interview. Read it, and ask only what it
  leaves open. If other files exist that you did not expect, ask what they are before touching them.
- `answers.md` in the directory: read it in full now. Match each answer to a node of the tree below.
  An answer settles its node; an answer that breaks a constraint in §3 does not, and becomes a question.
- Facts are yours to find, never the user's to supply: the host (`uname -sm`, `sw_vers`), whether
  `xcode-select -p`, `brew`, `xmake` exist, free disk (`df -h ~`), what the stack supports today (the
  tables in §3 and the skills `emulate`, `swiftui`, `backports`). Ask the user only for decisions.

## 2. Rounds

The **frontier** is every open node whose prerequisites are settled. Ask the whole frontier in one
round, then wait. A question that depends on another question still open this round waits for a later
round. After the answers, recompute the frontier and ask again.

One question, in this shape:

```
Q3 — Language: Objective-C or Swift?
<what depends on it, the options, the constraint that applies>
Recommended: <your answer and the one-line reason>
```

Number questions across the whole interview (Q1, Q2, … never restarting). Give options where the
answer is a choice. Keep a question to what the user can decide; never ask them to look something up.
If the environment offers a structured way to ask the user, use it; otherwise ask in plain text.

## 3. The tree

Prerequisites are in brackets. Recommendations must respect the constraints; if the user insists on
something the stack cannot do, say what fails and where, and ask again.

1. **Purpose** — what the app does in one sentence; its screens, each in one line; what the user does
   on each; the data it keeps; whether it talks to the network; gestures; notifications. Recommend the
   smallest first version that is still the app they asked for.
2. **Lowest iOS release** [1] — becomes `apple_minimum`. Constraints: Swift needs 6.0 or later;
   arm64 needs 7.0; armv7s needs 6.0; armv6 exists only up to 4.2.1; `weak` references need 5.0 (ARC
   below that is the skill `objc`'s question). Each device has a highest release it can run: check the
   pair against the devices in node 4.
3. **Releases to check** [2] — which releases the app is verified on. The emulator boots only some:
   iOS 3.0 to 6.1.3 on the devices it has profiles for; iOS 7 is declared but has never been booted;
   iOS 8 and 9 cannot be emulated. A release outside that range is verified on a real device or not
   at all — say so in the question.
4. **Devices** [2] — by model identifier. Emulator profiles exist for `iPhone1,1`, `iPhone1,2`,
   `iPhone2,1` (3GS), `iPhone3,1` (4), `iPhone4,1` (4S), `iPod1,1`, `iPod2,1`, `iPod4,1`, `iPad1,1`,
   `iPad2,1`. Ask whether the user has a real jailbroken device and which. Screen: iPhone and iPod
   320×480 points (Retina on iPhone 4, 4S, iPod 4), iPad 768×1024 points.
5. **Architectures** [2, 4] — derive, do not ask unless it is a real choice: armv7 covers every device
   from the 3GS on; the original iPhone, the 3G and the first two iPod touch generations need armv6
   and a release no later than 4.2.1; add arm64 only for 64-bit devices on 7.0 and later.
6. **Language** [2] — Objective-C or Swift. Recommend Objective-C below 6.0 (Swift cannot run there),
   and for anything that must also build for arm64 (Swift on this stack is verified on armv7 only).
7. **Interface** [6] — UIKit in code, or SwiftUI (Swift only). There are no nibs or storyboards: the
   interface is built in code. Before recommending SwiftUI, check whether the pinned Charon provides
   Eidolon (the skill `swiftui` says how); if it does not, say so and recommend UIKit.
8. **Combine** [6] — only with Swift; recommend it only when the app's data flow needs it.
9. **Frameworks and APIs** [1, 2] — list what the purpose needs (for example networking, storage,
   location, camera, maps). For each API introduced after the lowest release, look up whether the
   backports carry it (skill `backports`); the question is then "backport, or the older API?".
10. **Data, network, permissions** [1, 2, 9] — where data is kept (defaults, archive, plist, SQLite,
    Core Data), the servers it calls and whether they answer on that release's TLS, what the app
    asks the system for.
11. **Look** [2, 7] — the look of the lowest release (recommended: an iOS 6 app looks like iOS 6), or
    a custom one.
12. **Identity** — display name, bundle identifier (reverse DNS, the user's own domain or
    `com.<name>.<app>`), version, the Debian package name (usually the bundle identifier), the
    maintainer line `Name <email>` for the package, the icon (the user's PNG, or one you draw).
13. **Publishing** [4] — the `.deb` alone; installed on the user's device over SSH; or the user's own
    Cydia repository, and where it will be hosted.

## 4. Confirm

When the frontier is empty, show the decisions as one list and ask the user to confirm or correct.
Corrections reopen the nodes that depend on them. An `answers.md` that says the decisions are
confirmed counts as confirmation, but only if every node is settled.

If there is nobody to ask — you run without a user and `answers.md` leaves a node open or breaks a
constraint — stop. Write the open questions, with your recommendations, to the end of `PROJECT.md`
under `## Open questions`, report them, and create nothing else. Never settle a decision by guessing.

## 5. Write PROJECT.md

At the project root, in the user's words where they gave words:

- `## App` — purpose, screens (one line each), data, network, gestures.
- `## Target` — `apple_minimum`, releases to check, devices (identifiers and names), architectures.
- `## Code` — language, interface, Combine, frameworks, backports (each with the API that needs it).
- `## Identity` — name, bundle identifier, version, package name, maintainer, icon.
- `## Publishing` — the chosen target and, for a Cydia repository, where it is hosted.
- `## Progress` — one line per step, filled in by the later skills with the evidence (a log path,
  the verdict line, the `.deb` path): install, firmware, project, build, emulator, package, device,
  repository.

Then follow the skill `install`.

## Traps

- Asking the user for a fact (their macOS version, whether xmake is there) → look it up; the user
  answers decisions only.
- Accepting "Swift on iOS 5" or "arm64 on iOS 6" because the user asked → name the constraint and ask
  again; the build would fail at the first link or the app at launch.
- Creating the project "to save time" before confirmation → the interview reshapes the tree; files
  written early encode answers that were never given.
- Promising an emulator check on iOS 8 or 9 → there is no kernel for them; plan a device check or none.
