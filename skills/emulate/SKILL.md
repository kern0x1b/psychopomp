name: emulate
description: Check the app on an emulated old iPhone, iPod touch or iPad with Charon's `xmake emulate` (the Shade emulator) — add the emulator to the project, install the app's .deb and its dependencies into the image of the chosen device and iOS release, run a program in it and read the verdict (pass, fail, crash, timeout, boot-blocked), its output, log and last frame. Says which devices and releases boot, what a verdict proves, and what cannot be checked yet (an app launched through SpringBoard). Use after a green build, for the "check in the emulator" step, or when asked to run the app in the emulator, on iOS 3 to 6, on an iPhone 3GS, 4, 4S.

# Check in the emulator

`xmake emulate` boots the chosen firmware's own userland (launchd, SpringBoard, the system
daemons) in Shade, Charon's emulator, on the user's Mac, installs the project's packages into that
image and runs one program in it under a deadline. The outcome is a **verdict** with evidence on
disk. Read `PROJECT.md` first: `## Target` names the devices and the releases to check. Each pair
checked here gets a line in `## Progress`.

**Read "Checking an app" (§5) before promising the user anything.** Today the emulator cannot
launch an app the way a user's tap does; what it can prove about an app is narrower than "it runs".

## 1. What the emulator covers

- **Host:** macOS on Apple silicon only; anything else is refused before it starts.
- **Devices** (Shade profiles): `iPhone1,1`, `iPhone1,2`, `iPhone2,1` (3GS), `iPhone3,1` (4),
  `iPhone4,1` (4S), `iPod1,1`, `iPod2,1`, `iPod4,1`, `iPad1,1`, `iPad2,1`. No armv7s or arm64
  device: nothing from the iPhone 5 on. A device without a profile is refused, never replaced.
- **Releases** (Shade's Darwin kernels, chosen by firmware build): most releases from iPhone OS 1
  to iOS 7, with gaps among the point releases (3.1.x, 4.1 and 4.3.1 to 4.3.5 among them), and
  none from 8.0 on — iOS 8 and 9 cannot be emulated. A release without a kernel is refused with the
  list of kernels the emulator has.
- **What boots:** Shade's README says it boots firmware from iPhone OS 3.0 through iOS 6.1.3 in
  Charon's acceptance runs; iOS 7 is declared and has never been booted. Not every device and
  release pair inside that range has been booted: until one has on this machine, tell the user the
  check may not be possible. A pair that does not boot fails at its first `install` (§3), before
  any run.
- `-r RELEASE` picks the device's **earliest firmware not older than** that release: `-r 6.1` on
  an iPhone 4S emulates 6.1 (10B142), not 6.1.3. Pass the exact release from `PROJECT.md`; the
  line the run prints names the version and build actually emulated, record that one.
- Audio may not work in the emulator: an audio failure there is unchecked, not the app's fault.
  No network unless asked (§3), no camera, no GPS, no cellular. The display is drawn in software.

## 2. Add the emulator to the project

1. After the `includes("@addon/charon/apple-ios")` line of `xmake.lua`, add
   `includes("@addon/charon/emulate")`. It requires `charon@shade` (the emulator, built from
   source with CMake on first use), `charon@swiftshader` (its CPU graphics
   driver) and `charon@emulator-guest` (the runner that starts your program in the guest).
2. Configure again so they are installed: `xmake f -p iphoneos -a armv7 -y > .logs/config.log 2>&1`.

Check: `xmake where shade` prints an install folder; `.logs/config.log` has no `error:`.

**Disk and time, first use of a device and release:** the root filesystem is downloaded from
Apple's servers and unpacked into `~/.charon/firmware/rootfs/<device>/<version>_<build>/` (about
1.2 GB for an iOS 6 iPhone; skill `firmware`), then booted once past its first-boot data migration
into a **golden image** under `~/.charon/emulator/golden.noindex/` (about 1.5 GB, about 5 host
minutes for iOS 6). Every later install and run is an APFS clone of it: seconds and almost no
space. A golden image is keyed by device, build and the emulator package: a new Charon pin that
brings a new emulator builds a new golden image and removes the old one.

## 3. Install the app's packages into the image

Always name the device and the release; the defaults (`-r` = `apple_minimum`, `-d` = the first
device of the configured architecture) rarely match `PROJECT.md`.

```
xmake emulate -d iPhone4,1 -r 6.1.3 install > .logs/emulate-install-iPhone4,1-6.1.3.log 2>&1
```

`install` runs `xmake deb` first (the whole packaging of skill `package`: build, stage, sign,
imports refused rather than warned), then clones the golden image and unpacks the data of **every
.deb that step wrote** — the app's and, for an app that uses the backports, the
`org.charon.apple-backports` package — and runs each package's `preinst` and `postinst` against
the image the way dpkg does (`DPKG_ROOT`). The backports' `postinst` links the libraries built for
the image's own release and refuses a release outside its bands.

Check: one line `installed <file>.deb into <device> <version>` per package, and no `refused this
image`. The first `install` on a device and release also boots and builds its golden image; if that
boot fails, `install` stops with `<device> <build> did not get past <stage> within <n> seconds; the
emulator log is <path>`. No run and no verdict follow: record the pair as "not checkable here" and
tell the user. It does **not** run `uicache`: SpringBoard of that image does not know the app's icon.

Network: the guest has none by default (`isolated`). `-n loopback` or `-n host` on `run`, or
`set_values("emulate.network", "host")` on a target, gives it one; `host` shares the Mac's real
sockets.

## 4. Run a program and read the verdict

```
xmake emulate -d iPhone4,1 -r 6.1.3 [-s 60] run /absolute/path/in/the/guest [ARGS...] > .logs/emulate-run.log 2>&1
```

A fresh clone of the installed image boots; launchd starts `charon-runner` (from
`/etc/launchd.conf` up to iOS 6.x, from a LaunchDaemon from iOS 7), which starts
the command **as root** with a deadline of `-s` seconds (default 60) once launchd loads daemons,
and writes the command's exit status and output into the guest. The boot is stopped as soon as the
verdict exists, and killed after `-t` seconds (default 900) whatever happens. Expect several host
minutes per run.

A pass prints `pass on <device> <version> (<build>) in …`; any other verdict stops the command
with `error: <verdict> on <device> <version> (<build>) in …; the emulator log is <path>`.

| Verdict | Means |
| --- | --- |
| `pass` | the command exited 0 |
| `fail(exit N)` | it exited N |
| `fail(spawn error 2)` | there is no such file in the image: wrong path, or `install` not run |
| `crash(signal N, pc 0x…, last frame …)` | it died on signal N; the pc is where the CPU faulted, and the last frame is the host path of the run's `frame.png` |
| `timeout` | still running after `-s` seconds; the runner killed it |
| `boot-blocked(<where>…)` | the command never ran, although the image booted at `install`: the emulator, a process in a crash loop, SpringBoard or the data migration stopped the boot; a guest crash report's reason and a request that never got its reply are named |

`run` prints the command's own standard output and error before the verdict. The evidence stays in
`~/.charon/emulator/images.noindex/<project>-<hash>/<device>_<build>/run/`: `verdict.json`
(`state`, `guest_seconds`, `host_seconds`, `scale`), `results/test.stdout`, `results/test.stderr`,
`results/reports/` (the guest's crash reports), `emulator.log` and `frame.png`. It is replaced by
the next run of the same device and release: copy what you cite into the project's `.logs/`.

- `xmake emulate -d … -r … log [TEXT]` — the last run's output lines, and the emulator's fatal
  CPU faults and signal exits (or every line holding TEXT).
- `xmake emulate -d … -r … shot [FILE]` — copies the last frame (default
  `build/<device>_<build>.png`). Look at it; do not describe a frame you have not opened.
- `xmake emulate -d … -r … debug /path` — starts the program as the guest's **first process**
  (nothing else boots), stops where it crashes and prints the signal, the frames named by the
  images loaded and the registers; the report is `debug/debug.json` beside `run/`. Use it on a
  `crash(...)` of a program that does not need the rest of the system.

**Time scale.** The emulator is one to two orders of magnitude slower than the device, and the
guest measures its watchdogs in its own seconds. `--scale N` makes one guest second take N host
seconds; the default is 10 and is right for everything except a program that measures time. Such a
target says `set_values("emulate.timing", "strict")` and must be run with `--scale 1` (any other
scale is refused); at 1 the guest's own watchdogs kill long runs. A verdict always states the
scale; `guest_seconds` is the program's own clock.

## 5. Checking an app

**Current state (Charon 0.8.10 and main): the emulator cannot launch an app through SpringBoard.**
`run` starts a program from launchd, not from a tap on the home screen. An app's executable
started that way does not go through SpringBoard's launch, so `application:didFinishLaunching…`
is never reached and the app never draws; `frame.png` shows SpringBoard, not the app. There is no
command to tap, to launch by bundle identifier or to take a frame of the app.

What can be checked today, and how to word it in `## Progress`:

- **The package installs on that release:** `install` succeeded — the app's `.deb` and its
  dependencies unpacked, their maintainer scripts (the backports' band choice among them) accepted
  the release. Record the `installed … into <device> <version>` lines.
- **The imports resolve on that release:** already proven statically by the build and by
  `xmake deb` (skill `build`), against that release's own libraries. That is stronger evidence than
  an emulator run for "every symbol the app calls exists".
- **The app's logic runs on that release:** put the logic that does not need `UIApplication` (the
  model, parsing, persistence, the backported Foundation classes the app relies on) into a test
  stand — a small `@addon/charon/daemon` target in the same project that exercises it, prints each
  result and exits with the number of failures (skill `checks`). `run` that program: `pass` is real
  evidence on that device and release.

What cannot be checked here today: that the app launches from SpringBoard, draws its screens,
responds to taps and gestures, lays out on the device's screen, or survives backgrounding. Say so
to the user in these words, and check those on a real device (skill `device`) when the user has
one. Never write "the app runs in the emulator" in `## Progress`; write what was run and its
verdict.

This section changes when Charon gains an app launch for the emulator.

## 6. Record

In `PROJECT.md` `## Progress`, per device and release: the install log path and its `installed`
lines; for each `run`, the command, the verdict line exactly as printed (with the emulated
version, build and scale) and the path of the copied `verdict.json`/frame. Then follow the skill
`package` (or `checks` for more test stands).

## Traps

- `xmake emulate clean` → never while any other project or session on the machine may be
  emulating: it always removes the shared `tmp.noindex` and `cache.noindex` of every project, and
  `--all` every golden image. There is nothing to clean between runs; each run clones afresh.
- Leaving out `-d`/`-r` → the run emulates `apple_minimum` on the first catalog device of the
  architecture, often not the one `PROJECT.md` names; always pass both.
- Reading `fail(spawn error 2)` as an app bug → the path is not in the image; `install` first, and
  pass the guest path of a probe (`/usr/libexec/<name>`), not a host path. Never the app's own
  executable: started by the runner it never becomes an application (§5).
- `kAudioSession…NotInitialized`, silent sounds → audio may not work in the emulator; record it as
  unchecked, not as the app's fault.
- A run with `--scale 1` "to be realistic" → the guest's watchdogs expire (SpringBoard is lost to
  a mediaserverd timeout); keep 10 unless the target is `emulate.timing` strict.
- Treating a pair that does not boot (the first `install` stops with `did not get past`, or a run
  says `boot-blocked`) as the app's failure → it is the emulator's coverage; report it as "not
  checkable here".
- Two commands on the same project, device and release at once → the second waits for the first
  (per-image lock); several projects may emulate at once, each boot takes one of the machine's
  slots (`min(cores/3, RAM/5 GB)`) and waits for a free one.
- Results written only with `NSLog` → they go to the guest's system log, not to what `run`
  prints; write them with `printf` and `fflush(stdout)` (the runner captures standard output and
  error into `results/test.stdout` and `test.stderr`).
- Launching the app some other way (a hand-written LaunchDaemon for it, a launcher copied into the
  image, an edited image) → not a check of the app as a user starts it, and not a native path; the
  launch through SpringBoard is a limit of the emulator today (§5). Say so.
